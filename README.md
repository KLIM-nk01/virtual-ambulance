# Virtual Ambulance

This app is for doctors and patients
A medical application that solves the problem of patients making appointments with doctors, as this process is often problematic. For example, long waiting lists or the current epidemiological situation around the world. This application allows each patient, using a computer or any device with Internet access, to make an appointment with a doctor independently.
